## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Use of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags to represent an important value/image/number.
2. Use of the `<article>` tag to wrap a standalone content, meaning it has nothing to do with other parts, such as in this project in the summary data section.
3. Use of the **CSS** `display: flexbox;` property to set the behavior of elements to be responsive according to our wishes when the element is at a certain width.
4. I need to learn JavaScript to be able to display data dynamically, such as displaying data from `data.json`
